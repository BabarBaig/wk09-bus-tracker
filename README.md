# Real Time Bus Tracker

Load a map centered on the MIT campus.  
Press button on map to show animation of the bus route between MIT and Harvard.  

## To Execute

Clone this repo and load file index.html in a browser.  Note that in file mapanimation.js, near line 18, you need to enter an access token.
To get a token, visit https://account.mapbox.com and replace any existing token with your own token.
Without an access token, this repo will not work.
Note that based on traffic, at MapBox.com, page load might take a few moments.  
Once page loads, clinck on the crimson button on the top-left of the page.

## Future Improvements

1. Replace current animation with realtime updates of buses between MIT and Harvard.
2. Add a drop-down menu option to see realtime location of buses on any route in the grater Boston area.  Users planning to take the bus, can then monitor the closest bus from a sheltered location, stepping-over to the bus-stop only when the map shows the bus is approaching.  This can be helpful in inclement or extreme weather.
