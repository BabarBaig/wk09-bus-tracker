# Real Time Bus Tracker

Load a map centered on the MIT campus.  
Press button on map to show animation of the bus route between MIT and Harvard.  

## Improvements to the core project:
1. Original button looked more like a label.  This meant some users might-not realize it's a button, and not press it.  Change button to a 3D rounded button in MIT cardinal red with shadow effect.  When pressed, button shows an animated button-press.
2. Original project ran only once/load.  Reset counter in code so that when marker animation ends, pressing the button on the map restarts it from beginning
3. Change refresh speed from 1000ms to 750ms.   This hopefully make the updates a bit more dynamic and reduce risk of user losing interest.

## To Execute:
Clone this repo on your computer and load file index.html into a browser.
